This type of bot is different from regular bots in several aspects. For one, it is faster, more efficient, and versatile. \n Furthermore, AIO bots are limited in availability when compared to regular bots. The only way to access these bots is by invitation in most situations. Below are some of the most common features of AIO bots: \n Auto credit card check for multiple websites\nMultithreading support\nLink monitoring\nAuto-retry checkout\nProxy support \n So, why exactly do you need proxies for an AIO bot? Take a read below. \n "}, {"title": "Why Do You Need Proxies for AIO Bots", "description": "  There are several reasons why you need a proxy for an AIO bot. To begin with, in most cases, the “one pair per customer” rule applies to every limited-edition sneaker release nowadays. The high demand for such sneakers and other popular items, clothing, gadgets, and other products mainly necessitates this strategy. \n Still, users try to circumvent this rule by using an AIO bot. While this is an ingenious technique, you will get detected and banned if all your requests come from the same IP address. This is why you need proxies to make the most out of using AIO bots. \n Simply put, a proxy is an intermediary online server that stands between your device and the server you are accessing, which is an online shop in this case. A proxy handless all your internet traffic, sending your requests, and receiving responses on your behalf. \n What does this mean? Your device will lose all contact with the sneaker website, and the proxy will communicate with it instead, replacing your original IP address with its own. This has a wide range of benefits for sneakerheads. \n For starters, you can use a  sneaker proxy  to purchase sneakers from several websites without worrying about detection. This means you can circumvent the “one pair per customer” rule. Sneaker websites use IPs to identify users. Proxies make your orders look like they’re coming from several different customers, allowing you to complete as many purchases as you want. \n It’s also fairly common for limited-edition sneakers and other products to only be available in select regions. This may be inconvenient if you do not reside in these areas. You can use an alternative IP in a suitable location and circumvent this limitation with a proxy. The benefit? You can purchase limited-edition sneakers from anywhere. \n Lastly, suppose you get banned for whatever reason on a sneaker website. You can implement a proxy server to regain access and start over with a new account (or more). Most websites implement IP bans to protect users. Therefore, to avoid such prohibitions, all you have to do is change your IP address using a proxy service. \n In summary, a proxy is an absolute necessity for AIO bot users. In fact, one may go as far as to argue that this software cannot offer you much functionality without proxies. Why? It is designed to automate the sneaker purchase process on several websites at a single instance. This means the bot will be sending several requests at once, and this is more than likely to raise eyebrows since the requests will be coming from a single IP address. Hence, you can use several IP addresses to avoid detection with a proxy. \n "}, {"title": "Best Proxies for AIO Bots", "description": "  When it comes to AIO bots, residential and mobile proxies work best. Why? For starters, residential proxies are best if you use a PC for copping limited-edition sneakers. They source their IP addresses from real devices with ISP-issued IP addresses. In other words, this type of traffic is 100% authentic and impossible to differentiate from other regular users. Mobile proxies are best if you use a mobile device for copping limited-edition sneakers from different websites. These proxies are sourced from mobile network providers, so they’re just as efficient as residential proxies. \n IPRoyal is a premium proxy service renowned for serving clients from all over the globe.
