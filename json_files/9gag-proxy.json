Users can access the latest trending videos, memes, GIFs, and other things. How exactly does the website work? Read on to find out. \n It has three main parts: hot, trending, and fresh. When a user uploads content, it goes to the fresh category. If it gains more votes, it then proceeds to the trending type. The last class is hot. For content to be considered hot, it must have a tremendously large number of votes. 9gag has gained popularity in the community for its fun and excellent content. \n Ray Chan(CEO) and a group of four other individuals founded 9GAG on April 11, 2008, in Hong kong. The website’s main aim was to promote fun and entertainment within the social community. Accordingly, 9gag has the funniest memes, videos, and photos, among other content. If you are looking for a place to crack your ribs, 9GAG is your best bet. \n The name 9GAG is derived from Cantonese from ‘gou gag,’ which means make a joke. This makes perfect sense since the site shares funny content. As of September 2020, 9GAG was ranked the 151st most visited website globally. \n So, why exactly do you need proxies for 9GAG? Sometimes we may be in a situation where one can not access the site due to restrictions such as work policy. Well, if that is your situation, you no longer have to worry! Here’s how you can access 9GAG anonymously from anywhere using proxies. \n "}, {"title": "Why Do You Need Proxies for 9GAG?", "description": "  Before we get to why we need these proxies, what is a proxy? Proxy server acts as an intermediary between you and the site you are trying to browse. In simpler terms, a proxy is like a waiter in a restaurant. \n When you go to a restaurant, you order a meal, and the waiter hands your request to the chef. This is how proxies work. For example, in this case, when you look for content on 9GAG, the request is made to the proxy, which then hands it over to the website, thereby preserving your anonymity. \n First, you may want some privacy while accessing 9GAG. Proxies guarantee your privacy by hiding your IP address and displaying their own instead. Also, a proxy server ensures that your location remains private since the displayed location is that of the proxy server and not yours. \n "}, {"title": "What Are the Best Proxies for 9GAG?", "description": "  There are many proxies on the market, but the best option for 9GAG is residential or datacenter proxies. With residential proxies, you get IPs sourced from ISPs, making them traceable to actual devices and impossible to distinguish from other 9GAG users. \n However, datacenter proxies use IPs that are virtually generated in cloud servers. Depending on the need, both these proxies can work just fine for 9GAG. For instance, you should opt for a datacenter proxy if you are after speed. However, if you want a higher privacy level, then residential proxies are your best bet. \n While you may have an idea of the best proxies for 9GAG, one question still has not been sufficiently answered, which provider should you go for? First off, you should know that free proxies are risky. For one thing, it takes a lot of resources to maintain proxy servers. This means that free proxy providers will have to find an alternative way of financing their services. \n Most of the time, free proxy services do this by selling your personal data to third parties. This is the fundamental reason why you should stay away from such providers. Instead, you should opt for premium proxy server providers. At IPRoyal, we offer residential and static residential proxies that keep your activity anonymous without compromising privacy! \n "}], "faq": [{"question": "What is a 9GAG proxy?", "answer": "   This is an intermediary server between you and 9GAG that enables you to access the website while maintaining your anonymity by providing your requests with a new IP address. \n  "}, {"question": "What Is the best proxy server for 9GAG?", "answer": "   The best proxy for 9GAG is the residential proxy since it's nearly impossible to detect.
