The site's central hub presents a directory where users can select the category of image they seek. Because 4chan hosts any image without restriction, many people desire a level of privacy when browsing the boards. Additionally, some networks may block access to the platform entirely. A 4chan proxy is a perfect solution to these and other limitations. Read on to discover why our 4chan proxies are some of the best on the market. Whether you are looking to browse 4Chan images in private or getting yourself unbanned from the platform, we have the perfect proxy for you.", "jumbotron_image": "https://cms.iproyal.com/uploads/4chan_proxy_b17e7781da.png", "most_import": [{"title": "The Reason 4chan Hands out Bans", "description": "  You might think that a platform with hardly any restrictions would be impossible to get banned from, but 4chan does have some simple rules. The primary reasons for getting your account blocked or denied on the platform involve posting spam or uploading images to the wrong categories. Either of these actions can result in account restrictions. \n Typically, 4chan will not permanently ban an account outright but rather impose temporary blocks, usually fifteen or thirty days. While these ban periods may seem short, they can be excruciating in today’s culture of instant gratification. \n Posts on 4chan move at a surprisingly fast pace; even one day off of the platform can mean hundreds or even thousands of missed images. \n "}, {"title": "Bypassing a Ban From 4chan", "description": "  If you must get your 4chan fix before the ban timer expires, you can use a high-performance 4chan proxy to gain access. Proxies, by nature, act as a middleman, ensuring that the server only sees the proxy and not the actual client. Therefore, even if 4chan (or any website) bans your IP address, it won’t matter because your actual IP address remains private. \n The other type of block that 4chan may implement is an account ban. These bans do not only block an IP address but rather the registered account itself. A proxy can also assist in circumventing these blocks by allowing you to re-register a new account. 4chan will not stop the new registration because your IP address and location information remain hidden behind the proxy. \n Even if your ban is permanent, you can register and log in because the server sees your proxied device as a completely new client. You could even theoretically register and maintain multiple accounts simultaneously utilizing proxies. \n "}, {"title": "Could You Use Tor for 4chan?", "description": "  Tor is an anonymous web browser that allows full and unrestricted access to the entire internet, including what is commonly called the “dark web.” Tor is an acronym for “The Onion Router” and offers several layers of encryption beyond the standard web browser. \n Since Tor is generally understood to be an incognito browser, could you use Tor to access 4chan? The answer is not really. While Tor offers several anonymous service ranges (called “onions”), it also opens the door to hazardous and illegal activities. Not only is the chance of being infected with malware significantly increased, but your risk of encountering illicit activities is also higher. \n While Tor is not exclusively for illegal activities, it is more complicated to set up for the average user and more challenging to use safely. Any privacy benefits you may gain from using it can be offset by the pitfalls you may encounter. \n A proxy offers superior anonymity and safety since it’s easier to configure and deploy on your LAN at the router level. \n "}, {"title": "Residential Proxies for 4chan Bots", "description": "  Another use for 4chan proxies is facilitating the use of bots. A bot on 4chan can execute several tasks, from automating posting to collecting various kinds of data. Some companies monitor 4chan to keep updated on current trends, while others catalog the media. \n If you’re familiar with other bots such as Reddit bots, 4chan bots offer many of the same features, including upvoting and scraping. \n Because 4chan is an image and video board, you need a proxy capable of keeping up with all the media downloads. You also want a service that won’t sacrifice your privacy to gain a little extra speed (or a quick profit). Therefore, the provider you choose needs to be trustworthy with an exceptional reputation. \n While there are many proxy providers to choose from, you should exercise care. Some providers will try to lock you into long-term contracts or collect usage data or logs. \n At IPRoyal, we believe that your data belongs to you and no one else.
